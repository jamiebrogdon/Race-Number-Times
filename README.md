A simple Javascript project working through conditionals.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I started by writing psuedocode on how we would take the information given to create the conditional. I started by setting up a math method using math.random to randomize the runners numners that are assigned to each runner as they register. Adding in Math.floor to round down the number given as it could have spit out a decimal - which is not what we want! 
Next, creating my 'buckets of memory' aka variables, that would change as we go, so with this knowledge I used 'let' to set us up for success later. We needed a variable for the registration (if its early or late) and the runners age (over 18 or under).
I then created a if / else statement using a template literal, the variables needed and mathmetical operators to confirm if a runner was early, late, and over 18 or under 18. Since I am not creating a web application or site for this project, we will console log the information to see what the runner is placed in.

## Optimizations

If I went back into this project, I would shorthand the if / else statements using a ternery operator as opposed to the longer version - if this is possible. I played around with changing the interger from a negative to a positive, and was unable to figure out at this time how to use that method.


## Lessons Learned:

After this project, I feel so much more confident in my ability to read and write if / else statements and the syntax involved. I really enjoyed learning more about which operators to use when, and reading the documentation for the math methods and skimming over some of the future possibilities - which seem endless, truly.
